*“With Material For the Spine, I was interested in alloying a technical approach to the improvisational results. It is a system for exploring the interior and exterior muscles of the back. It aims to bring the light of consciousness to the dark side of the body, that is, the sides not much self-seen, and to submit sensations to the mind often using visually observed body elements in self definition during dance.”* Steve Paxton
